# Hi there 👋

## I'm Shawn, an evolutionary and plant biologist passionate about understanding adaptation and evolution through comparative genomics. I currently work at the University of Illinois, where I use Python, R, and bioinformatics tools to study plant systems, focusing on the evolutionary pathways that drive diversity.

### 🔥 I’m currently working on projects related to the synteny network of angiosperm genomes and the evolutionary analysis of Brassicales, examining how genetic changes correspond to metabolic adaptations.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning more about advanced data visualization techniques in R to better communicate my research findings.

### 💪 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that combines comparative genomics, plant biology, bioinformatics, and bioethics. If you're interested in metabolic pathways, evolutionary convergence, or justice ✊🏾, let's connect!

### 🥷🏾 Pronouns: They/Them

### ✨ Fun fact: My spice cabinet is arranged phylogenetically.

### ✉ How to reach me: Feel free to drop me an email at rsa@illinois.edu or connect with me at @youngeukaryote.bsky.social.

## Thanks for stopping by! Let’s explore evolution together.
